		// Destroying an std::condition_variable when not all threads waiting on it have been notified
		// invokes undefined behavior (e.g., it may be nicely destroyed or it may be awaited forever.)
		// That means other threads could still be running the body of std::condition_variable::wait()
		// but already past the safety checkpoint. That's the case for instance if that function is already
		// waiting to lock again.
		//
		// We will make the rule a bit more restrictive and simpler to understand at the same time: there
		// should not be any threads at any stage of the waiting by the time the semaphore is destroyed.
		//
		// We do so because of the following reasons:
		// - We have the guideline that threads must be awaited (i.e., completed), so the waiting thread
		//   must be completely done by the time the thread controlling it finally destroys the semaphore.
		//   Therefore, only a coding mistake could make the program run into such a attempt at premature
		//   destruction of the semaphore.
		// - In scripting, given that Semaphores are wrapped by RefCounted classes, in general it can't
		//   happen that a thread is trying to destroy a Semaphore while another is still doing whatever with
		//   it, so the simplification is mostly transparent to script writers.
		// - The redefined rule can be checked for failure to meet it, which is what this implementation does.
		//   This is useful to detect a few cases of potential misuse; namely:
		//   a) In scripting:
		//      * The coder is naughtily dealing with the reference count causing a semaphore to die prematurely.
		//      * The coder is letting the project reach its termination without having cleanly finished threads
		//        that await on semaphores (or at least, let the usual semaphore-controlled loop exit).
		//   b) In the native side, where Semaphore is not a ref-counted beast and certain coding mistakes can
		//      lead to its premature destruction as well.
		//
		// Let's let users know they are doing it wrong, but apply a, somewhat hacky, countermeasure against UB
		// in debug builds.
		std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
		if (awaiters) {
			WARN_PRINT(
					"A Semaphore object is being destroyed while one or more threads are still waiting on it.\n"
					"Please call post() on it as necessary to prevent such a situation and so ensure correct cleanup.");
			// And now, the hacky countermeasure (i.e., leak the condition variable).
